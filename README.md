The above images show soome of the functionality and the UI aspects of the web application that was developed. These include the sign up feature that was implemented and the adding of a recipe. These were both implemented through the use of forms within the applications folder.

The above image represents the unit testing that was carried out for this project across all of the files in the applications folder. 

## <ins>**Issues**</ins>

Some issues were faced when attempting to implement an update form function into the application. This had worked previously but some more work needs to be done to add this as a working function into the app. 

Integration testing and the use continuous integration unfortunately was not able to be implemented due to various issues and time constraints.
